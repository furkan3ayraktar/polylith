  Poly 0.1.0-alpha9 (2020-12-23) - https://github.com/polyfy/polylith

  poly CMD [ARGS] - where CMD [ARGS] are:

    check                       Checks if the workspace is valid.
    create E name:N [ARG]       Creates a component, base, project or workspace.
    deps [project:P] [brick:B]  Shows dependencies.
    diff                        Shows changed files since last stable point in time.
    help [C] [ARG]              Shows this help or help for specified command.
    info [ARGS]                 Shows a workspace overview and checks if it's valid.
    libs                        Shows all libraries in the workspace.
    test [ARGS]                 Runs tests.
    version                     Shows current version of the tool.
    ws [get:X]                  Shows the workspace as data.

  If ws-dir:PATH is passed in as an argument, where PATH is a relative
  or absolute path, then the command is executed from that directory.
  This works for all commands except 'test'.

  If :: is passed in, then ws-dir is set to the first parent directory
  (or current) that contains a 'deps.edn' workspace config file. The exception
  is the 'test' command that has to be executed from the workspace root.

  If ws-file:FILE is passed in, then the workspace will be populated with the
  content from that file. All commands except 'create' and 'test'
  can be executed with this parameter set. The FILE is created by executing the
  'ws' command, e.g.: 'poly ws out:ws.edn'.

  If since:SINCE is passed in as an argument, the last stable point in time
  will be used depending on the value of SINCE (or the first commit if no match
  was found):
    stable          -> the latest tag that matches stable-*, defined by
                       :stable-tag-pattern in ./deps.edn.
    build           -> the latest tag that matches v[0-9]*, defined by
                       :release-tag-pattern in ./deps.edn.
    previous-build  -> the latest tag that matches v[0-9]*,
                       defined by :release-tag-pattern in ./deps.edn.

  The color mode can be overridden by passing in e.g. color-mode:none
  (valid values are: none, light, dark) which is otherwise configured in
  ~/.polylith/config.edn.

  Example:
    poly check
    poly create c name:user

### check
```
  Validates the workspace.

  poly check

  Prints 'OK' and returns 0 if no errors were found.
  If errors or warnings were found, show messages and return the error code, 
  or 0 if only warnings. If internal errors, 1 is returned.

  Error 101 - Illegal dependency on namespace.
    Triggered if a :require statement refers to a component namespace other
    than interface. Examples of valid namespaces:
     - com.my.company.mycomponent.interface
     - com.my.company.mycomponent.interface.subns
     - com.my.company.mycomponent.interface.my.subns

  Error 102 - Function or macro is defined twice.
    Triggered if a function or macro is defined twice in the same namespace.

  Error 103 - Missing definitions.
    Triggered if a def, defn or defmacro definition exists in one component's
    interface but is missing in another component that uses the same interface.

  Error 104 - Circular dependencies.
    Triggered if circular dependencies were detected, e.g.:
    Component A depends on B that depends on A (A > B > A), or A > B > C > A.

  Error 105 - Illegal name sharing.
    Triggered if a base has the same name as a component or interface.
    Projects and profiles can be given any name.

  Error 106 - Multiple components that share the same interfaces in a project.
    Triggered if a project contains more than one component that shares the 
    same interface.

  Error 107 - Missing components in project.
    Triggered if a component depends on an interface that is not included in the
    project. The solution is to add a component to the project that
    implements the interface.

  Error 108 - Components with an interface that is implemented by more than one 
              component are not allowed for the development project.
    The solution is to remove the component from the development project 
    and define the paths for each component in separate profiles
    (including test paths).

  Error 109 - Missing libraries in project.
    Triggered if a project doesn't contain a library that is used by one
    of its bricks. Library usage for a brick is calculated using :ns-to-lib in
    './deps.edn' for all its namespaces.

  Warning 201 - Mismatching parameter lists in function or macro.
    Triggered if a function or macro is defined in the interface for a component
    but also defined in the same interface for another component but with a
    different parameter list.

  Warning 202 - Missing paths in project.
    Triggered if a path in a project doesn't exist on disk.
    The solution is to add the file or directory, or to remove the path.

  Warning 203 - Path exists in both dev and profile.
    It's discouraged to have the same path in both the development project
    and a profile. The solution is to remove the path from dev or the profile. 

  Warning 204 - Library exists in both dev and a profile.
    It's discouraged to have the same library in both development and a profile.
    The solution is to remove the library from dev or the profile.

  Warning 205 - Reference to missing library in :ns-to-lib in ./deps.edn.
    Libraries defined in :ns-to-lib should also be defined by the project.

  Warning 206 - Reference to missing namespace in :ns-to-lib in ./deps.edn.
    Namespaces defined in :ns-to-lib should also be defined by the project.

  Warning 207 - Non top namespace was found in brick.
    Triggered if a namespace in a brick doesn't start with the top namespaces
    defined in :top-namespace in ./deps.edn.
```

### create
```
  Creates a component, base, project or workspace.

  poly create TYPE [ARGS]
    TYPE = c[omponent] -> Creates a component.
           b[ase]      -> Creates a base.
           p[roject]   -> Creates a project.
           w[orkspace] -> Creates a workspace.

    ARGS = Varies depending on TYPE. To get help for a specific TYPE, type:
             poly help create TYPE

  Example:
    poly create c name:user
    poly create component name:user
    poly create component name:admin interface:user
    poly create base name:mybase
    poly create project name:myproject
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
```

#### create component
```
  Creates a component.

  poly create c name:NAME [interface:INTERFACE]
    NAME = The name of the component to create.

    INTERFACE = The name of the interface (namespace) or NAME if not given.

  Example:
    poly create c name:user
    poly create component name:user
    poly create component name:admin interface:user
```

#### create base
```
  Creates a base.

  poly create b name:NAME
    NAME = The name of the base to create.

  Example:
    poly create b name:mybase
    poly create base name:mybase
```

#### create project
```
  Creates a project.

  poly create p name:NAME
    NAME = The name of the project to create.

  Example:
    poly create p name:myproject
    poly create project name:myproject
```

#### create workspace
```
  Creates a workspace.

  poly create w name:NAME top-ns:TOP-NAMESPACE
    NAME = The name of the workspace to create.

    TOP-NAMESPACE = The top namespace, e.g. com.my.company.

  Example:
    poly create w name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
    poly create workspace name:myws top-ns:com.my.company
```

### deps
```
  Shows dependencies.

  poly deps [project:PROJECT] [brick:BRICK]
    (omitted) = Show dependencies for all bricks.
    PROJECT   = Show dependencies for specified project.
    BRICK     = Show dependencies for specified brick.

  To get help for a specific diagram, type: 
    poly help deps ARGS:
      ARGS = :project         Help for the project diagram.
             :brick           Help for the brick diagram.
             :bricks          Help for the bricks diagram.
             :project :brick  Help for the project/brick diagram.
  Example:
    poly deps
    poly deps project:myproject
    poly deps brick:mybrick
    poly deps project:myproject brick:mybrick
```

#### deps :bricks
```
  Shows all brick dependencies.

  poly deps

         p      
         a  u  u
         y  s  t
         e  e  i
  brick  r  r  l
  --------------
  payer  ·  x  x
  user   ·  ·  x
  util   ·  ·  ·
  cli    x  ·  ·

  In this example, payer uses user and util, user uses util,
  and cli uses payer. Each usage comes from at least one :require
  statement in the brick.
```

#### deps :brick
```
  Shows dependencies for selected brick.

  poly deps brick:BRICK
    BRICK = The name of the brick to show dependencies for.

  used by  <  user  >  uses
  -------              ----
  payer                util

  In this example, user is used by payer and it uses util itself.

  Example:
    poly deps brick:mybrick
```

#### deps :project
```
  Shows dependencies for selected project.

  poly deps project:PROJECT
    PROJECT = The project name or alias to show dependencies for.

         p      
         a  u  u
         y  s  t
         e  e  i
  brick  r  r  l
  --------------
  payer  ·  x  x
  user   ·  ·  x
  util   ·  ·  ·
  cli    x  +  +

  When the project is known, we also know which components are used.

  In this example, payer uses user and util, user uses util, and cli uses payer.
  The + signs mark indirect dependencies. Here the cli base depends on user and
  util, via 'cli > payer > user' and 'cli > payer > util'. Each usage comes from
  at least one :require statement in the brick. 

  Example:
    poly deps project:myproject
```

#### deps :project :brick
```
  Shows dependencies for selected brick and project.

  poly deps project:PROJECT brick:BRICK
    PROJECT = The project (name or alias) to show dependencies for.
    BRICK   = The brick to show dependencies for.

  used by  <  user  >  uses
  -------              ----
  payer                util

  In this example, user is used by payer and it uses util itself.

  Example:
    poly deps project:myproject brick:mybrick
```

### diff
```
  Shows changed files since the most recent stable point in time.

  poly diff

  Internally, it executes 'git diff SHA --name-only' where SHA is the SHA-1
  of the first commit in the repository, or the SHA-1 of the most recent tag
  that matches the default pattern 'stable-*'.

  Stable points are normally set by the CI server or by individual developers,
  e.g. Lisa, with 'git tag -f stable-lisa'.

  The pattern can be changed in :stable-tag-pattern in ./deps.edn.

  The way the latest tag is found is by taking the last line of the output from:
    git tag --sort=committerdate -l 'stable-*'

  Here is a compact way of listing all the commits including tags:
    git log --pretty=oneline
```

### info
```
  Shows workspace information.

  poly info [ARGS]
    ARGS = :loc   -> Shows the number of lines of code for each brick
                     and project.

  In addition to :loc, all the arguments used by the 'test' command
  can also be used as a way to see what tests will be executed.

    stable since: dec73ec | stable-lisa

    projects: 2   interfaces: 3
    bases:    1   components: 4

    active profiles: default

    project       alias  source   default  admin
    ---------------------------   --------------
    command-line  cl      ---       --      --
    development   dev     x--       --      --

    interface  brick    cl    dev  admin
    -----------------   ---   ----------
    payer      payer    x--   xx-   --
    user       admin    x--   ---   xx
    user       user *   ---   xx-   --
    util       util     x--   xx-   --
    -          cli      x--   xx-   --

  This example shows a sample workspace. Let's go through each section:

  1. stable since: dec73ec | stable-lisa

     Shows the most recent commit marked as stable, or the last release if 
     since:release or since:previous-release was given, or the first commit
     in the repository if no tag was found, followed by the tag (if found).
     More information can be found in the 'diff' command help.

  2. projects: 2   interfaces: 3
     bases:    1   components: 4

     Shows how many projects, bases, components and interfaces there are
     in the workspace.

  3. active profiles: default

     Shows the names of active profiles. The profile paths are merged into the
     development project. A profiles is an alias in ./deps.edn that starts
     with a +. If no profile is selected, the default profile is automatically
     selected.

     Profiles are activated by passing them in by name (prefixed with '+'), e.g.:
       poly info +admin +onemore

     To deactivate all the profiles, and stop 'default' from being merged into
     the development project, type:
       poly info +

  4. project       alias  source   default  admin
     ---------------------------   --------------
     command-line  cl      ---       --      --
     development   dev     x--       --      --

    This table lists all projects. The 'project' column shows the name
    of the projects, which are the directory names under the 'projects',
    directory except for 'development' that stores its code under the
    'development' directory.

    The 'deps.edn' config files are stored under each project, except for
    the development project that stores it at the workspace root.

    Aliases are configured in :project-to-alias in ./deps.edn.

    The 'source' column has three x/- flags with different meaning:
      x--  The project has a 'src' directory, e.g.
           'projects/command-line/src'.
      -x-  The project has a 'test' directory, e.g.
           'projects/command-line/test'.
      --x  The project tests (its own) are marked for execution.

    To show the 'resources' directory, also pass in :r or :resources, e.g.
    'poly info :r':      x---  The project has a 'src' directory, e.g.
            'projects/command-line/src'.
      -x--  The project has a 'resources' directory, e.g.
            'projects/command-line/resources'.
      --x-  The project has a 'test' directory, e.g.
            'projects/command-line/test'
      ---x  The project tests (its own) are marked for execution.

    The last two columns, default admin, are the profiles:
      x-  The profile contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g.
          'projects/command-line/src'.
      -x  The profile contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
          'projects/command-line/test'.

    If also passing in :r or :resources, e.g. 'poly info +r':
      x--  The profile contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g.
           'projects/command-line/src'.
      -x-  The profile contains a path to the 'resources' directory, e.g.
           'projects/command-line/resources'.
      --x  The profile contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
           'projects/command-line/test'.

  5. interface  brick    cl    dev  admin
     -----------------   ---   ----------
     payer      payer    x--   xx-   --
     user       admin    x--   ---   xx
     user       user *   ---   xx-   --
     util       util     x--   xx-   --
     -          cli      x--   xx-   --

    This table lists all bricks and in which projects and profiles they are
    added to.

    The 'interface' column shows what interface the component has. The name
    is the first namespace after the component name, e.g.:
    com.my.company.user.interface

    The 'brick' column shows the name of the brick, in green if a component or
    blue if a base. Each component lives in a directory under the 'components'
    directory and each base lives under the 'bases' directory. If any file for
    a brick has changed since the last stable point in time, it will be marked
    with an asterisk, * (user in this example).

    The changed files can be listed by executing 'poly diff'.

    The next cl column is the command-line project that lives under the
    'projects' directory. Each line in this column says whether a brick is
    included in the project or not.
    The flags mean:
      x--  The project contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g.
           'components/user/src'.
      -x-  The project contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
           'components/user/test'.
      --x  The brick is marked to be executed from this project.

    If :r or :resources is also passed in:
      x---  The project contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g. 
            'components/user/src'.
      -x--  The project contains a path to the 'resources' directory, e.g.
            'components/user/resources'.
      --x-  The project contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
            'components/user/test'.
      ---x  The brick is marked to be executed from this project.

    The next group of columns, dev admin, is the development project with
    its profiles. If passing in a plus with 'poly info +' then it will also show
    the default profile. The flags for the dev project works the same
    as for cl.

    The flags for the admin profile means:
      x-  The profile contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g.
          'components/user/src'.
      -x  The profile contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
          'components/user/test'

    If :r or :resources is also passed in:
      x--  The profile contains a path to the 'src' directory, e.g.
           'components/user/src'.
      -x-  The profile contains a path to the 'resources' directory, e.g.
           'components/user/resources'.
      --x  The profile contains a path to the 'test' directory, e.g.
           'components/user/test'.

  It's not enough that a path has been added to a project to show an 'x',
  the file or directory must also exist.

  If any warnings or errors were found in the workspace, they will be listed at
  the end, see the 'check' command help, for a complete list of validations.

  Example:
    poly info
    poly info :loc
    poly info since:release
    poly info since:previous-release
    poly info project:myproject
    poly info project:myproject:another-project
    poly info :project
    poly info :dev
    poly info :project :dev
    poly info :all
    poly info :all-bricks
    poly info ws-dir:another-ws
    poly info ws-file:ws.edn
```

### libs
```
  Shows all libraries that are used in the workspace.

  poly libs [:all]
    :all = View all bricks, including those without library dependencies.
                                                                              u  u
                                                                              s  t
                                                                              e  i
    library                       version     KB   cl   dev  default  admin   r  l
    --------------------------------------------   --   -------------------   ----
    antlr/antlr                   2.7.7      434   x     x      -       -     ·  x
    clj-time                      0.15.2      23   x     x      -       -     x  ·
    org.clojure/clojure           1.10.1   3,816   x     x      -       -     ·  ·
    org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha  0.8.695     46   x     x      -       -     ·  ·

  In this example we have four libraries used by the cl and dev projects.
  If any of the libraries are added to the default or admin profiles, they will appear
  as 'x' in these columns.

  The 'x' in the user column, tells that clj-time is used by that component
  by having at least one :require statement that includes a clj-time namespace.

  Libraries are only specified per project, and the way it finds out which libraries
  are used for a specific brick, is by looking in :ns-to-lib in ./deps.edn
  which in this case has the value {clj-time clj-time, antlr antlr/antlr}.

  Libraries are selected per project and it's therefore possible to have different
  versions of the same library in different projects (if needed).

  This table supports all three different ways of including a dependency:
   - Maven, e.g.: clj-time/clj-time {:mvn/version "0.15.2"}
   - Local, e.g.: clj-time {:local/root "/local-libs/clj-time-0.15.2.jar"}
   - Git, e.g.: {:git/url "https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time.git"
                 :sha     "d9ed4e46c6b42271af69daa1d07a6da2df455fab"}

  The KB column shows the size in kilobytes, which is the size of the jar
  file for Maven and Local dependencies, and the size of all files in the
  ~/.gitlibs/libs/YOUR-LIBRARY directory for Git dependencies.
```

### test
```
  Executes brick and/or project tests.

  poly test [ARGS]

  The brick tests are executed from all projects they belong to except for the development
  project (if not :dev is passed in):

  ARGS              Tests to execute
  ----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
  (empty)           All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed.

  :project          All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed +
                    tests for changed projects.

  :all-bricks       All brick tests.

  :all              All brick tests + all project tests (except development).


  To execute the brick tests from the development project, also pass in :dev:

  ARGS              Tests to execute
  ----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
  :dev              All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed,
                    only executed from the development project.

  :project :dev     All brick tests that are directly or indirectly changed,
                    executed from all projects (development included) +
                    tests for changed projects (development included).

  :all-bricks :dev  All brick tests, executed from all projects
                    (development included).

  :all :dev         All brick tests, executed from all projects
                    (development included) + all project tests
                    (development included).

  projects can also be explicitly selected with e.g. project:proj1 or project:proj1:proj2.
  :dev is a shortcut for project:dev.

  Example:
    poly test
    poly test :project
    poly test :all-bricks
    poly test :all
    poly test project:proj1
    poly test project:proj1:proj2 :project
    poly test :dev
    poly test :project :dev
    poly test :all-bricks :dev
    poly test :all :dev
```

### ws
```
  Prints or writes the workspace as data.

  poly ws [get:ARG] [out:FILE]
    ARG = keys  -> Lists the keys for the data structure:
                   - If it's a hash map, it returns all its keys.
                   - If it's a list and its elements are hash maps, 
                     it returns a list with all the :name keys.

          count -> Counts the number of elements.

          KEY   -> If applied to a hash map, it returns the value of the KEY.
                   If applied to a list of hash maps, it returns the hash map with
                   a matching :name. Projects are also matched against :alias.

          INDEX -> A list element can be looked up by INDEX.

          Several ARG keys can be given, separated by colon.
          Every new key goes one level deeper into the workspace data structure.

    FILE = Writes the output to the specified FILE. Will have the same effect
           as setting color-mode:none and piping the output to a file.
  Example:
    poly ws
    poly ws get:keys
    poly ws get:keys
    poly ws get:count
    poly ws get:settings
    poly ws get:user-input:args
    poly ws get:user-input:args:0
    poly ws get:settings:keys
    poly ws get:components:keys
    poly ws get:components:count
    poly ws get:components:mycomp:lines-of-code-src
    poly ws out:ws.edn
    poly ws color-mode:none > ws.edn
```
